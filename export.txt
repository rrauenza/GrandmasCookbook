1 bag small slivered almonds

Toast almonds lightly then chop them. Set aside.  Melt butter in a sauce pan.  Add Sugar and turn to medium heat.  Stir constantly with a wooden spoon.  Mixture will turn a toffee color.  Cook to 300° to 310° for brittle toffee.  Cook to a lower temperature if you want it not as hard.  I like mine to break easily and not so hard. You can drizzle with your spoon some of the candy in a small bowl of cold water to taste and test it's brittleness.  Pour toffee onto a foil lined cookie sheet.  Scatter chocolate chips on top of the toffee.  When melted, spread them out evenly and sprinkle with the almonds.  Place in refrigerator.  When completely set and cold, break apart into pieces with your hands.

If toffee mixture separates, back off the heat and continue stirring until recombined.

to taste cumin
6 peeled - cut into small cubes potatoes
1 - 8 oz. package  Monterey Jack cheese
to cover potatoes water
|
Fry tomato, onions  and chilies in a large saucepan.  Add salt, pepper, garlic salt and cumin.    Add enough water to cover the potatoes.  Bring water to a boil and cook potatoes until tender,

Add grated cheese.  After cheese melts, serve.

If you want to make it a creamed soup:  remove the onions and chilies and puree the cooked potatoes and tomatoes in the water.  Then return the onions and chilies to the pureed mix.  Add cheese.  (I prefer cheddar cheese instead of jack cheese when I make this a creamed soup.)  Finish with adding half & half
