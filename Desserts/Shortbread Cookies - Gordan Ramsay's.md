* 325°
* Cook Time: 15-20 min
* Yield: 30

### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 teaspoon fine salt
* 1 cup butter (2 sticks)

### Directions

Preheat oven to 325°. Stir flour with salt and set aside. Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixture until smooth and creamy. At its lowest setting, add flour a little at a time until combined. Shape into a flattened ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 20 minutes.

Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/4-in thick. Stamp out cookies using a 2 1/4-in round cookie cutter.

Transfer to lightly buttered cookie sheets. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until pale golden. Cool. If desired sprinkle with additional sugar.
