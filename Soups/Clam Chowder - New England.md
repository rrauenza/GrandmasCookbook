## Clam Chowder - New England

* Serves: 4

### Ingredients

* 3 - 6.5 oz. cans minced clams
* 1 cup minced onion
* 1 cup diced celery
* 2 cups cubed potatoes
* 1 cup diced carrot
* 3/4 cup butter
* 3/4 cup flour
* 1 quart half-and-half
* 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* to taste pepper

### Directions

Drain juice from clams into a large skillet over the onions, celery, potatoes and carrots. Add water to cover, and cook over medium heat until tender. Meanwhile, in a large, heavy saucepan, melt butter over medium heat, whisk flour until smooth. Whisk in cream constantly stirring until thick and smooth. Stir in vegetables and clam juice. Heat through, but do not boil. Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar, and season with salt and pepper.
