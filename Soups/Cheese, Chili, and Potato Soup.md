# Soups

## Cheese, Chili, and Potato Soup

* Serves: 4

### Ingredients

* 3 medium tomatoes
* 1 large onion
* 6 raw green California Chilies
* to taste salt & pepper
* to taste garlic powder
* to taste cumin
* 6 peeled - cut into small cubes potatoes
* 1 - 8 oz. package Monterey Jack cheese
* to cover potatoes water

### Directions

Fry tomato, onions and chilies in a large saucepan. Add salt, pepper, garlic salt and cumin. Add enough water to cover the potatoes. Bring water to a boil and cook potatoes until tender,

Add grated cheese. After cheese melts, serve.

If you want to make it a creamed soup: remove the onions and chilies and puree the cooked potatoes and tomatoes in the water. Then return the onions and chilies to the pureed mix. Add cheese. (I prefer cheddar cheese instead of jack cheese when I make this a creamed soup.) Finish with adding half & half
