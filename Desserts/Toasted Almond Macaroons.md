## Toasted Almond Macaroons

* 350Â° parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
* These are made without flour - Gluten free
* Cook Time: 12-14 min

### Ingredients

* 3 cups unsweetened shredded Coconut
* 1 cup sliced almonds
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 large egg whites

### Directions

Spread coconut on a baking sheet; toast in oven for 4 minutes until light brown. Let cool. Put almonds on a baking sheet; toast for 8 minutes until light brown. Let them cool then pulse them in a food processor until coarsely ground. Transfer almonds to a mixing bowl and stir in coconut and salt.

In a separate bowl combine condensed milk, vanilla and egg whites, then gently blend in the coconut mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes.

Remove from refrigerator and scoop out small rounds of dough, about 1 1/2 tablespoons each onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes until faintly golden on the tips and sides.
