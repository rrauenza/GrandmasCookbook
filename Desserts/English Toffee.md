## English Toffee

* Use a foil lined cookie sheet

### Ingredients

* 2 cups butter (4 sticks)
* 2 cups sugar
* 1 - 11.5 oz. bag chocolate chips
* 1 bag small slivered almonds

### Directions

Toast almonds lightly then chop them. Set aside. Melt butter in a sauce pan. Add Sugar and turn to medium heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon. Mixture will turn a toffee color. Cook to 300° to 310° for brittle toffee. Cook to a lower temperature if you want it not as hard. I like mine to break easily and not so hard. You can drizzle with your spoon some of the candy in a small bowl of cold water to taste and test it's brittleness. Pour toffee onto a foil lined cookie sheet. Scatter chocolate chips on top of the toffee. When melted, spread them out evenly and sprinkle with the almonds. Place in refrigerator. When completely set and cold, break apart into pieces with your hands.

If toffee mixture separates, back off the heat and continue stirring until recombined.
