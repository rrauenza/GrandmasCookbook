Continue to microwave in 15 sec. increments, if necessary, stirring each time; until mixture is smooth.  Place 3/4 of mixture into 2 small bowls leaving 1/4 in the prep bowl to leave white.  Tint one bowl of mix red and one bowl of mix green., stirring each and tinting each to desired color.  You will then have 3 colors, white, red and green.  Drop heaping tablespoons of white, red and green mix into bottom of pan to create random pattern.  Continue until you have dropped all of the three mixes into the pan.  Pull a table knife through the layers of the mix for a marble effect.  Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.
